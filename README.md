# 2024 No New Book Challenge

Welcome to my 2024 No New Book Challenge! This year, my reading journey is centered around savoring the literary treasures already on my bookshelves.
Join me as I navigate through the diverse realms of fiction, non-fiction, poetry and even dive into the tech world with “Learn Python with Jupyter”.
Throughout the months, I’ll explore thought-provoking titles, engage with various book clubs, and embark on a reflective adventure with “The Happiness Project” by Gretchen Rubin.
